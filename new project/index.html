              <h2>Save Energy, Save Money, Save Nation, Save the planet.</h2>
              <h5>Conserving electrictiy can have a positive impact on the environment. Here are some tips to reduce power consumption.</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><u><b>Switch off when not in use.</b></u></li>
                Did you know: Your electronic appliances use as much as 75% of their electricity consumption when switched off?

A simple tour of your home will likely prove you have at least several plugged-in items you’re not using. For example, electrical items on standby, such as TV’s, computers and video games consoles. Many of these appliances draw a small amount of electricity whilst waiting for use.
                <br>
                <br>
               <li><u><b>Use large appliances together to reduce energy use</b></u></li>
               Whereas your modern washing machine and dryer may be marked energy-efficient, even energy efficient appliances still consume a lot of electricity with each use.

To conserve electricity as much as possible, pool your laundry together (as a family or roommates) and do full loads all at once. As a result, you cut down on the number of times you end up using the washer every week. If it helps, think about how much money you’re throwing away with each wash of an item or two. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><u><b>Install energy-efficient light bulbs</b></u></li>
                Talking about lighting, another great substitute is to swap incandescent lights for a compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) or LED bulbs. CFLs use between 50-80% less energy than regular incandescent bulbs.

You’ll find these more expensive to purchase at first than regular bulbs, which use more energy. But, they will last a lot longer than the regular ones. As a result, over time, the cost balances out as you save more energy. CFL's are especially practical for exterior lighting, which you may require left on throughout the night.
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><u><b>Stay up to date on maintenance to save energy</b></u></li>
                Your appliances will work more effectively and save you electricity at home if they are cared for. For example, when your air conditioner air filters clog up, you might choose to turn it up higher because the regular temperature doesn’t do so much anymore, using more energy.

By changing the filter (monthly, as recommended), you can get enough cold air at a minimal temperature, and you’ll note a reduction in your utility bills. The same applies to your dishwasher, tumble dryer, and other appliances.
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><u><b>Unplug & defrost your freezer monthly</b></u></li>
                Your freezer benefits from occasionally defrosting, usually once a month. When excessive ice builds up in the freezer, the system ends up working harder to preserve all that ice and keep cool air flowing. As a result, a freezer in need of a defrost uses more energy and adds to your energy costs.

                Whenever you want to defrost, simply unplug the freezer and remove all food items. Leave the door open for a faster melting process, and then dry out the freezer. Turn it back on, and once cool, repack your food items. Ensure that you place items correctly to allow easy flow of cooling air and improved energy saving (so your freezer’s system doesn’t work too much!).
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><u><b>Use your microwave instead of your stove</b></u></li>
                Along with other household chores, reheating food is a necessary and also energy-taxing process. Depending on your preference, a stove may preserve the flavor of food a little better. Independent of taste, however, there is evidence to suggest that a microwave is more energy efficient. The nature of a stove makes it prone to losing energy. A microwave, while using a lot of electricity, uses relatively short bursts of power for small amounts of time.
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><u><b>Switch to alternate power source like solar</b></u></li>
                There’s always an option to set up a complete solar system in your house, but that’s an expensive proposition. What we are saying is to cut some corners with balcony lights, or garden lights. There are outdoor solar lights, fans or a small solar system can do the same job at minimal cost.
